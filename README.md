# `wrangler-pages-functions-dev` React SPA hello-world example

This is a very minimal example/template built via `npm create vite` using the [Vite React TS starting template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/e7d38ab1c45b9d17f182f89d0c129932e2f994eb/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) (with very minimal tweaks) which allows the application to work with Cloudflare Pages Functions during local development by using the [`wrangler-pages-functions-dev`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrangler-pages-functions-dev) Vite Plugin.

To try this example install its dependencies:
```sh
$ npm i
```
and simply run:
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
